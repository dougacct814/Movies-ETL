# Movies-ETL

## Challenge Assignment 8:

Challenge was to write a Python script that performs all three ETL steps on the Wikipedia and Kaggle data. Utilize the code you created in your Jupyter Notebook but leave out any code that performs exploratory data analysis, and you may need to add code to handle potentially unforeseen errors due to changes in the underlying data.

### GOALS

- Create an automated ETL pipeline.
- Extract data from multiple sources.
- Clean and transform the data automatically using Pandas and regular expressions.
- Load new data into PostgreSQL.
